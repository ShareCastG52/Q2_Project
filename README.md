# ShareCast
ShareCast, a social way to share podcasts between friends, stimulating conversation on topics you care about. Track podcasts, share episodes and (later) get notifications on when your friends have listened to podcasts youâ€™ve shared so that you can have a deeper discussion and build intellectual bridges with your friends and family.

Changing lives, one podcast at a time.
